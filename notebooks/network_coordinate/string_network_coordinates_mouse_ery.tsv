Binds two molecules of 5-aminolevulinate per subunit, each at a distinct site, and catalyzes their condensation to form porphobilinogen (By similarity); Belongs to the ALAD family.
Blvrb	10090.ENSMUSP00000043092	0.43084016393442626	0.4918181818181818	rgb(239,201,117)	Flavin reductase (NADPH); Broad specificity oxidoreductase that catalyzes the NADPH- dependent reduction of a variety of flavins, such as riboflavin, FAD or FMN, biliverdins, methemoglobin and PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone). Contributes to heme catabolism and metabolizes linear tetrapyrroles. Can also reduce the complexed Fe(3+) iron to Fe(2+) in the presence of FMN and NADPH. In the liver, converts biliverdin to bilirubin.
