Chgb	10090.ENSMUSP00000028826	0.482	0.5655932203389831	rgb(163,255,101)	Secretogranin-1; Secretogranin-1 is a neuroendocrine secretory granule protein, which may be the precursor for other biologically active peptides.
Cpe	10090.ENSMUSP00000048555	0.42938461538461536	0.2635593220338983	rgb(0,142,178)	Carboxypeptidase E; Sorting receptor that directs prohormones to the regulated secretory pathway. Acts also as a prohormone processing enzyme in neuro/endocrine cells, removing dibasic residues from the C-terminal end of peptide hormone precursors after initial endoprotease cleavage. Belongs to the peptidase M14 family.

Gnas	10090.ENSMUSP00000140174	0.5133846153846154	0.3764406779661017	rgb(0,178,23)	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha isoforms XLas; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers in numerous signaling pathways controlled by G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs). Signaling involves the activation of adenylyl cyclases, resulting in increased levels of the signaling molecule cAMP. GNAS functions downstream of several GPCRs, including beta-adrenergic receptors. XLas isoforms interact with the same set of receptors as Gnas isoforms.
Grb10	10090.ENSMUSP00000091011	0.6186153846153847	0.32457627118644067	rgb(101,142,255)	Growth factor receptor-bound protein 10; Adapter protein which modulates coupling of a number of cell surface receptor kinases with specific signaling pathways. Binds to, and suppress signals from, activated receptors tyrosine kinases, including the insulin (INSR) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF1R) receptors. The inhibitory effect can be achieved by 2 mechanisms: interference with the signaling pathway and increased receptor degradation. Delays and reduces AKT1 phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation. Blocks association between INSR and IRS1 and IRS2 and prevents insulin [...] 
Pcsk1n	10090.ENSMUSP00000040342	0.37492307692307697	0.5655932203389831	rgb(47,0,178)	Big PEN-LEN; May function in the control of the neuroendocrine secretory pathway. Proposed be a specific endogenous inhibitor of PCSK1. ProSAAS and Big PEN-LEN, both containing the C-terminal inhibitory domain, but not the processed peptides reduce PCSK1 activity in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. It reduces the activity of the 87 kDa form but not the autocatalytically derived 66 kDa form of PCSK1. Subsequent processing of proSAAS may eliminate the inhibition. Slows down convertase-mediated processing of proopiomelanocortin and proenkephalin. May control the intracellular timing o [...]

Rbms3	10090.ENSMUSP00000131371	0.41646153846153844	0.7333898305084746	rgb(255,183,101)	RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 3; Binds poly(A) and poly(U) oligoribonucleotides.
Rbp4	10090.ENSMUSP00000025951	0.5410769230769231	0.690677966101695	rgb(166,178,0)	Retinol-binding protein 4; Retinol-binding protein that mediates retinol transport in blood plasma. Delivers retinol from the liver stores to the peripheral tissues. Transfers the bound all-trans retinol to STRA6, that then facilitates retinol transport across the cell membrane.
