# NeuroVelo: interpretable learning of cellular dynamics
NeuroVelo: physics-based interpretable learning of cellular dynamics. It is implemented on Python3 and PyTorch, the model estimate velocity field and genes that drives the splicing dynamics.

The main contributions of NeuroVelo are,

- Using linear projection and embedding for spliced and unspliced RNA to keep interpretability.
- Introducing sample specific velocity estimation, and sample specific interpretation of cellular dynamics.
- Presenting a loss function based on splicing dynamics.
